VIT_MAE_START_DOCSTRING = r"""
    This model is a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass. Use it
    as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and
    behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`ViTMAEConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

    Args:
        pixel_values (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_channels, height, width)`):
            Pixel values. Pixel values can be obtained using [`AutoFeatureExtractor`]. See
            [`AutoFeatureExtractor.__call__`] for details.

        head_mask (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*):
            Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

            - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
            - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

        output_attentions (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
            tensors for more detail.
        output_hidden_states (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
            more detail.
        return_dict (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return a [`~utils.ModelOutput`] instead of a plain tuple.
